/****  DESIGN BEST PRACTICES  ****/
/* Use 2-3 well-paired fonts, but no more.
/* Adjust font style, size, weight, spacing, and color.
/* Whitespace plays a big part in readability. Make sure all of your text elements have enough whitespace.
/* Use standard convention for links and navigation buttons so users know what to expect. (button looks or underlines in text). Never use blue text.
/* Use columns when necessary to keep line length at around 50-75 characters.
/* Use colored cards to pair images with important text so usersâ€™ eyes are drawn towards it.
/* Have the elements you want users to notice at the top of the page, or down the left-hand side because those are the areas of the page users will notice when skimming.
